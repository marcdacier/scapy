# scapy
This repository contains a number of simple scapy scripts used within a lecture given at KAUST (King Abdullah University of Sciences and Technology) 
entitled "Applied Network Security", given by M. Dacier (marc.dacier@kaust.edu.sa)
These scripts can be used 'as is' within a dedicated GNS3 environment created for that lecture.
If you want to use it in another environment, you will have to modify a few things here and there.

These scripts are part of a paedagogical process and, therefore, some of them contain intentionally bugs, vulnerabilities, misleading statements or errors.
Handle with care and know what you do.
